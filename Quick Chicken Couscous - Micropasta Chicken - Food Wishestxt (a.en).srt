00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,160
hello this is chef john from

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:09,519
foodwishes.com with

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,000
quick chicken couscous that's right

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,559
right not only is this very fast and

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,719
easy

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,839
it's also beautiful delicious and

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,960
incredibly versatile

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,600
and will work with almost any

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,480
ingredients and why this stuff isn't way

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,039
more popular

12
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,640
is one of the great culinary mysteries i

13
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,320
mean once you have everything prepped

14
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,760
which doesn't take very long at all

15
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,599
we're talking about having a truly

16
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,640
gorgeous meal ready in about 10 or 15

17
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,399
minutes

18
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,320
i know it sounds too good to be true but

19
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,000
it is and to get started we're going to

20
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,480
measure exactly one and a half cups of

21
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,719
whole wheat couscous into this bowl

22
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,079
and contrary to popular belief couscous

23
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,840
is not a grain

24
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,360
it's actually a very very tiny whole

25
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,719
wheat pasta

26
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,200
and by the way there's actually two

27
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,680
types regular and quick cooking

28
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,160
or instant and we definitely want to use

29
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,680
the quick cooking kind for this

30
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,239
and then to our couscous we will add

31
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,480
some salt as well as some freshly ground

32
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,320
pepper and a few shakes of cayenne

33
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,559
followed by three tablespoons of olive

34
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,240
oil which is one of the big keys to the

35
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,520
whole operation

36
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,680
and what we'll do is take a spoon and

37
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,960
give this a thorough mixing until each

38
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,000
and every one of those little tiny

39
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,240
grains of pasta

40
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,560
is coated with the oil and once we're

41
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,479
100 positive that's been accomplished

42
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,640
we will finish by leveling off and

43
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,080
smoothing out the top

44
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,159
and just in case you're not familiar

45
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,880
with how this works all we need to do to

46
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,040
cook this

47
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,080
quote unquote is to pour in a cup of

48
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,400
boiling liquid

49
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,680
usually some kind of flavorful broth at

50
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,560
which point we cover it

51
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,799
wait five minutes and then we eat and

52
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,880
that's it it really is that simple

53
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,479
which reminds me make sure you tear off

54
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,200
a piece of foil big enough to cover this

55
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,720
bowl

56
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,640
since as soon as we pour in our hot

57
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,840
broth we are going to need to cover this

58
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,159
immediately

59
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,759
so make sure you have that ready and

60
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,720
that's it once our couscous bowl has

61
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,560
been prepped

62
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,560
we can move on to a totally optional

63
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,960
step and that would be to season the

64
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,719
chicken breast on both sides with salts

65
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,159
and then searing it over high heat and a

66
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,680
little bit of olive oil

67
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,360
in the same saucepan we're going to use

68
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,479
to boil our broth

69
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,560
oh and if you're going to include

70
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,759
something like red onions which i am

71
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,840
and you want to give those a little bit

72
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,680
of a head start we will bring those over

73
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,879
to the stove as well

74
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,959
and all we're going to do here is give

75
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,480
this chicken breast a quick sear

76
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,640
since meat that's browned always has a

77
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,920
little more flavor but as you'll see

78
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,520
it's also going to form a little bit of

79
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,280
a fond on the bottom of the pan

80
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,360
which means even more flavor going into

81
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,640
our broth once we heat that up

82
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,720
so we'll go ahead and sear that first

83
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,080
side for about two or three minutes

84
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,080
at which point we will toss in our

85
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,720
onions and we'll saute those for a few

86
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,160
minutes while our second side browns

87
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,080
and no i have no idea what that

88
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,599
mysterious slash is

89
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,760
okay i didn't get anywhere close to this

90
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,120
with a knife so i'm guessing whoever at

91
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,280
the factory took off the skin

92
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,800
must have nicked it or at least that's

93
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,319
what i hope it was

94
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,480
but anyway once we browned our chicken

95
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,080
breast for a few minutes on both sides

96
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,840
and we've taken the raw edge off those

97
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,879
onions we'll remove everything from the

98
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,640
heat

99
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,440
and we will transfer that into a bowl to

100
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,800
cool before we cube it up

101
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,800
and i could have left the onions in the

102
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,159
pan but i wanted you guys to get a great

103
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,840
look at that fond

104
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,360
which is that beautiful caramelization

105
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,879
that happens when you sear something in

106
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,319
a pan

107
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,840
and that even though we only cooked our

108
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,319
chicken for a few minutes is going to

109
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,239
provide a lot of extra flavor

110
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,680
speaking of which let's go ahead and

111
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,080
transfer in that one cup of liquid i

112
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,400
mentioned

113
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,840
earlier which in my case is a nice rich

114
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,280
chicken broth

115
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,959
and then we'll follow that with whatever

116
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,319
vegetables we're going to include

117
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,519
which for me is going to be some diced

118
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,680
zucchini some sliced green beans

119
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,200
some diced sweet red pepper and then a

120
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,319
little bit of freshly sliced green

121
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,760
onions

122
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,760
and the reason we want to cut this stuff

123
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,959
nice and small is because we pretty much

124
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,280
want this stuff tender

125
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,400
by the time our broth reaches a boil

126
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,239
which is only going to take a few

127
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,400
minutes as you will see

128
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,239
so that's looking good and at this point

129
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,680
we'll go back and cut up our chicken

130
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,519
which i'm going to do by cutting it into

131
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,040
strips lengthwise

132
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,120
and then we'll turn it and cut across

133
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,640
into like half inch pieces

134
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,480
and i should mention you can also use

135
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,319
thighs for this and it will work out

136
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,080
just about the same

137
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,080
or which is even a more common way for

138
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,760
me to make this you can use cut up

139
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,319
leftover cooked chicken

140
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,760
which obviously saves you a whole step

141
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,920
so keep this in mind the next time you

142
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,439
roast chicken if you have some leftovers

143
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,599
this recipe is definitely something you

144
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,959
should be eating the next day

145
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,040
and that's it once our chicken's been

146
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,280
cut up we will add that along with our

147
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,720
onions to the rest of the ingredients

148
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,800
at which point we are ready to finish

149
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,240
off our quick chicken couscous

150
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,240
so we'll go ahead and place this over

151
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,600
high heat and we will wait for that to

152
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,680
begin to simmer

153
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,000
and while we do we can toss in any other

154
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,280
spices or seasonings we feel like

155
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,759
which for me was a little touch of

156
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,639
smoked paprika plus a little bit of

157
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,160
turmeric

158
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,080
which not only fights every major

159
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,639
disease it's also going to give our

160
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,160
couscous an even more beautiful color

161
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,160
right we used to call that poor man

162
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,840
saffron when it was okay to use

163
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,440
expressions like that

164
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,440
but anyway we'll go ahead and stir that

165
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,800
in and like i said we'll wait for this

166
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,160
to start simmering

167
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,880
and once it does we'll give it a quick

168
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,600
stir and then maybe wait one more minute

169
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,240
for it to come to a full boil and by

170
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,240
then

171
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,840
because we diced our vegetables small

172
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,880
and our chicken was also in nice small

173
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,800
pieces

174
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,880
by the time this is boiling everything

175
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,560
should be just barely cooked

176
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,720
so once boiling we will pull this off

177
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,199
the heat and we will safely but very

178
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,280
quickly dump it into our couscous

179
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,320
but we are not going to stir right we're

180
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,080
just going to toss it in

181
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,039
quickly spread it out and then wrap it

182
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,080
with foil okay immediately and very very

183
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,600
tightly

184
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,280
and then as soon as that's wrapped we

185
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,560
will set our timer for exactly five

186
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,320
minutes

187
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,680
and then once our timer rings we'll go

188
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,360
ahead and unwrap this

189
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,919
and we will toss in some freshly chopped

190
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,880
parsley and or the fresh herbs of your

191
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,080
choice

192
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,240
and then we'll take a spoon and give

193
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,000
everything a stir and because every

194
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,120
little piece of couscous was coated in

195
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,440
olive oil

196
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,960
as we break this up while we stir every

197
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,080
little particle of couscous will

198
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,520
separate

199
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,440
and it will take on a very light and

200
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,039
fluffy texture

201
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,039
and of course before serving you have to

202
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,880
taste and adjust for salt

203
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,319
as it often needs another pinch which

204
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,919
mine did

205
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,240
so i went ahead and added some stirred

206
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,600
it in and gave it another taste

207
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,600
and then once we're happy with that

208
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,960
we'll go ahead and serve it up

209
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,520
and then i like to garnish with some

210
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,360
crumbled feta but a nice garlicky yogurt

211
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,160
sauce would also be beautiful

212
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,560
or maybe something like a zotziki so as

213
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,240
usual final garnishing is up to you

214
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,400
and i ended up finishing mine with some

215
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,840
chili flakes a little more freshly

216
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,319
chopped parsley

217
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,319
and a final drizzle of olive oil and

218
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,080
that's it our quick chicken couscous is

219
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,840
ready to enjoy

220
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,759
and that my friends for something that

221
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,759
only takes a few minutes to prep

222
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,199
and literally five minutes to cook

223
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,479
really does make for an incredibly

224
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,400
impressive meal

225
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,160
right that couscous is satisfying and

226
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,520
filling while at the same time being

227
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,120
fairly light

228
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,440
and because our chicken pieces were only

229
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,560
briefly cooked they should be moist and

230
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,000
tender

231
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,919
and what i love about this recipe

232
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,199
besides everything is that we can do

233
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,240
this with so many different kinds of

234
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,160
vegetables

235
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,080
okay as long as they're diced small or

236
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,400
pre-cooked a little bit like the onions

237
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,000
they're gonna work perfectly in this so

238
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,120
i really do hope you adapt this to your

239
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,440
tastes

240
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,800
i mean you are after all the dr seuss of

241
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,560
your couscous

242
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,440
and this really is a perfect dish for

243
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,599
personal variations and adaptations

244
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,880
oh and speaking of being versatile this

245
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,000
is wonderful hot

246
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,759
magnificent warm fantastic room temp

247
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,840
and you can even chill it and bring it

248
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,440
to a picnic as a salad

249
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,440
which in that case i like to splash in a

250
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,039
little bit of vinegar or maybe squeeze

251
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,599
in some fresh lemon

252
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,080
and it really is delicious chilled but

253
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,759
anyway

254
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,280
that's it what we're calling quick

255
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,560
chicken couscous

256
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,720
if you're ready to take a little bit of

257
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,560
a break from pasta rice and potatoes

258
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,720
i think this makes for a great change of

259
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,840
pace but whether you need your pace

260
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,680
changed or not

261
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,080
